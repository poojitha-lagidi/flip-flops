# FlipFlops (FF)
Flip Flops are memory elements in a digital circuit and are basic building blocks of sequential circuits. FF are **edge triggered** which change their state on rising or falling edge of a clock signal and is more suitable for synchronous systems. <br />
Edge triggering is also called as **Dynamic Triggering** where output changes with respect to input only at instants of selected **level transitions**. When level changes from '_0_' to '_1_' or '_1_' to '_0_' then it is called level transition.
